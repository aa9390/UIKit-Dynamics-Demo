# UIKit-Dynamics-Demo
Sample usage of UIDynamics to create an animated floating circles  background animation.

Possible circle diameters are finite set of values, as well as the colors. They are moving due to the forces inside UIFieldBehavior.noiseField
When someone taps on the screen all the circles are trying to reach your finger with the help of UIFieldBehavior.radialGravityField.

Blurred & Vibrant Masks are applied. (UIVisualEffectView)
This demo is written in Swift 3.0
